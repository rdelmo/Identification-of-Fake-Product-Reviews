# Identification of Fake Product Reviews

**Abstract**

Detecting fake online reviews in e-commerce is even more challenging because of increased review sophistication and volume. This project explores AI for accurate and automated identification of fake reviews. NLP techniques extracted linguistic, behavioural, and sentiment features from reviews. Using 44,000 labelled reviews, traditional supervised machine learning approach was adopted (LR, NB, DT, SVM, RF, AdaBoost, KNN, and Stacking). AdaBoost was identified as the optimal model; when hyperparameter-tuned, it achieved 82% accuracy and 91% ROC AUC on the test set. This means the model effectively distinguished between real and fake reviews. In conclusion, the project achieved all its outlined objectives. Future work includes using more powerful computational resources, exploring advanced features like n-grams and user metadata, and comparing performance with transformer models.
